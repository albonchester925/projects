[cgijs](https://www.github.com/cgi-js) - Run cgi / interpreted script files that supports command line execution, or connect to cgi / other server proxies, [git repo](https://github.com/cgi-js/cgi-js) , [npmjs cgijs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cgijs)

`CGIJS` is a library to run any CGI mode / Interpreted language script files, or connect to any web application server proxies, or manage processes in the system. `CGIJS` library:

- Supports running any `CGI` / `Interpreted Language scripts` in `any OS` that runs `node.js`.
- Supports both `CGI` executables as well as `proxy` to `localhost`/ `remote` /`embedded servers` using proxying of multiple protocols (`http`, `websockets`, `tcp`, `udp`, `socks`, `ssh`, `ftp`).
- Supports managing processes like `embedded` `server` executables, embedded `database` executables, or `any other` embedded/ non-embedded executables

[phpcgijs](https://github.com/cgi-js/node-php-cgi) - Run php scripts like wordpress, drupal, etc with node and cgi counter parts, [git repo](https://github.com/cgi-js/node-php-cgi), [npmjs phpcgijs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phpcgijs)

Run php scripts like wordpress, drupal, etc with node and cgi counter parts using `phpcgijs`. The script will pipe all files that end in the .php extension through the php parser. All other files will be served as static content. Basic permalinks are supported but the support for them can probably be improved.

Includes `CGIJS` Library as a dependancy.

[fastprimenumbers](https://github.com/ganeshkbhat/fastprimenumbers) - Probably the fastest prime number calculations, [git repo](https://github.com/ganeshkbhat/fastprimenumbers), [npmjs fast-prime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-prime), [pypi fastprime]()

`Fastest Prime Number Calculation (checks) logic` and This probably is the BEST solution in the internet as of today 11th March 2022. This same code has been applied in many languages (and can be applied to) like `Python`, `Go` Lang, `Java`, `PHP`, `Node.js`, `Javascript`, `typescript`, `C` and can be applied to `C++`, `.NET`, `Rust`, etc with the same logic and have performance benefits. It is pretty fast based on the number of iterations needed. Performance time checks were not consistent across languages (in my local system - to be direct about wordings). I have not seen this implemented before and has been indigenously done. Feedback and usage is welcome.

`Max iterations 16666 for n == 100000 instead of 100000 of conventional way.`
