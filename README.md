#### fastprimenumbers

Status: `[production ready]`

`Fastest Prime Number Calculation (checks) logic` and This probably is the BEST solution in the internet as of today 11th March 2022. This same code has been applied in many languages (and can be applied to) like `Python`, `Go` Lang, `Java`, `PHP`, `Node.js`, `Javascript`, `typescript`, `C` and can be applied to `C++`, `.NET`, `Rust`, etc with the same logic and have performance benefits. 


It is pretty fast based on the number of iterations needed. Performance time checks were not consistent across languages (in my local system - to be direct about wordings). I have not seen this implemented before and has been indigenously done. Feedback and usage is welcome.

`Max iterations 16666 for n == 100000 instead of 100000 of conventional way.`
